		<p> My name is Hannah Reynolds and I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am working on obtaining a Community & Nonprofit Leadership degree with a minor in Global Health and Digital Studies. Through my countless hours of volunteer work with the Leukemia Lymphoma Society, I found my passion for nonprofits. I was able to learn skills such as networking, public speaking, planning meetings, and more through the nonprofit. Finally, spending a semester studying abroad in London I have gained international work and course experience to build a more diverse background. Through all of my involvement, I have still been able to maintain an above average GPA. </p>
