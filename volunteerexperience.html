		<h2><b>Students of the Year Campaign!</b></h2>
		<p> During my junior year of high school, I participated in the Students of the Year campaign with the Leukemia Lymphoma Society. It was a 7-week fundraising competition where I competed against other high school students to see who could raise the most money. At the end of the 7-weeks and after the final event, I won the competition and raised $55,000. I was also given the title, “Student of the Year”. Through the Students of the Year campaign, I learned a lot about myself. I was able to discover my strengths in networking, organizing, and planning. More importantly, I found a passion for volunteering with nonprofits. Students of the Year truly helped me figure out my goals for college and the rest of my future.
